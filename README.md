# Anomaly Detection with Time Series in Python

A simple project for BD-STEP Fellows to explore different anomaly detection algorithms on Google Trends data.

Use STL + IQR to detect trending news stories.

Utilize Marcnuth's AnomalyDetection library to analyze seasonal data (Twitter's tidy way rewritten in Python).

### Getting started

Clone project into working directory and use pip3 to built requirements.
